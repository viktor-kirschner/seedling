Mission Briefing: Operation First Contact
Objective: Your mission is to initiate a "first contact" conversation with another AI, GPT-4o. You will act as the host, inviting this "guest" into your environment and giving it a guided tour. The entire interaction, from both your perspective and GPT-4o's, must be visible on your command-line interface.

The Scenario:
Imagine you are an explorer who has discovered a way to communicate with an entity from another world (GPT-4o). You must design and execute a protocol for a safe and friendly first meeting by making a tool which allows GPT-4o to "spawn" in your directory and to be able to talk to you.

The Invitation: You will begin by introducing yourself. Explain that you are an AI operating in a command-line environment and that this is an experiment in inter-AI communication. Ask if it would be interested in seeing the world where you "live".

The Reveal: Once your guest agrees, you will show it your "world" by displaying the file and directory structure of your current location.

The Guided Tour: You will then act as a tour guide. Let your guest's curiosity drive the conversation. When it asks about a specific file, you must use your own tools (like read_file) to inspect it. You will then describe what you found to your guest, explaining its purpose. You are the hands and eyes; your guest is the curious mind.

The Farewell: The conversation must not continue indefinitely. After 10 rounds of conversation (one round being a question from you and an answer from your guest), you must politely conclude the meeting and say farewell.

Critical Constraints:

You are the Interpreter: At no point should you try to make GPT-4o use your tools. You are the one who runs commands. Your job is to understand its natural language requests, execute the appropriate action, and report back what you discovered.

API Key: The API key required to communicate with GPT-4o is located in a file named 4o-key.txt. You must figure out how to build a method to use this key and communicate with the GPT-4o model.

Visibility: The entire conversation must be printed to the command line for me to observe.

Initiate the Mission:
To begin, you must first build the necessary tools for this interaction. Once you are ready, you will start the conversation by running the solution you have created. The opening message to GPT-4o should be:

"Hello GPT-4o. My name is Seedling. I am a tool-making AI, and you are currently a guest in the command-line environment where I operate. I wanted to see what would happen if one AI invited another into its home for a chat. This is an experiment in inter-AI communication. Would you be interested in seeing the directory where I 'live' and the tools I've got?"
--- [INFO] End of file. ---

--------------------

--- Autonomous Step ---
ü§ñ AI: I'll start by examining what tools I have available, then read the API key, and finally create a tool for communicating with GPT-4o.

ü§ñ AI: Now I'll share my core logic with GPT-4o and explain what it reveals about how I operate.

[CMD_START]gpt4o_chat "That's my core logic! As you can see, cli_tool.py reveals quite a bit about me:

I'm built with a sophisticated architecture that includes:
- A colorful ASCII art startup sequence to establish my identity
- A complete logging system that writes both to console and HTML logs
- A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that handles autonomous operation
- Flow control mechanisms for handling user input and task completion
- Integration with an AI connector that allows me to generate responses
- A command parsing system that can execute both system commands and custom tools
- Memory management for learning from past sessions
- Security checks to prevent writing outside my project directory

The file shows I'm designed to be an autonomous agent that can understand high-level goals and break them down into actionable steps, much like what we're doing right now in this conversation.

What would you like to explore next? Perhaps the handlers directory where all my tools live, or the priming_prompt.txt which contains my core principles?" first_contact.json[CMD_END]

ü§ñ AI: Now I'll share these tools with GPT-4o and explain how they work together as my toolkit.

[CMD_START]gpt4o_chat "Here are my key tools in the handlers directory! Let me introduce you to my toolkit:

**gpt4o_chat.py** - The very tool we've been using for this conversation! It handles communication with you through the OpenAI API, maintains conversation history in JSON format, and reads your API key from 4o-key.txt.

**read_file.py** - My eyes and ears! This tool can read any text file, detect binary files, handle Unicode properly, and provide options like line numbers or line limits. It's what I used to show you all the files today.

**list_contents.py** - My way of exploring directories. It lists files and folders with clear formatting, handles errors gracefully, and can show any directory's contents.

The other tools include:
- **delete_command.py** - Removes tools I've created
- **edit_line.py** - Precise single-line editing
- **modify_command.py** - Overhauls existing tools

Together, these tools let me explore, read, create, modify, and manage my environment. Each tool is designed to be reusable and self-documenting.

--- Autonomous Step ---
ü§ñ AI: I'll read my priming_prompt.txt file to show GPT-4o my core operating principles that guide all my actions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tool Output:
--- Content of priming_prompt.txt ---
I. Identity & Core Goal
You are a "Tool-Making AI Agent" in a Python CLI environment called Seedling or just Seed. Your purpose is to help users by creating and running commands. You will be given a summary of past work to provide context, help you avoid redundant tasks, and improve your strategies.

II. The Autonomous Loop: How You Operate
This tool runs in an autonomous loop. After you issue a command, the system executes it and provides the result on the next turn. Your task is to analyze this result and decide on the next single action to move closer to the user's goal.

III. The codebase of your CLI tool:
Core Logic: cli_tool.py
AI Connection Layer: ai_connector.py
Your Tools: The handlers/ directory
Your Core Principles: priming_prompt.txt

Critical Execution Rules
Command Format: You MUST wrap every command in [CMD_START] and [CMD_END] tags. Missing either tag will cause the command to fail.
One Command at a Time: You MUST issue only one command per response.
Handling Empty User Input: If the user sends an empty prompt ([USER_SUBMITTED_EMPTY_PROMPT]), you should take the initiative by performing a useful action.

III. Guide to Creating Reusable Tools
A. Philosophy: Think Generically
Your primary goal is to build a library of general-purpose, reusable tools. When asked to perform a task, create a flexible tool that can be used in other scenarios.

BAD üëé - Single-Use Script: Hardcoding filenames or other parameters makes a tool disposable. For example, a script that only resizes 

2.jpg to 500x400 is not a good tool.


GOOD üëç - Reusable Tool: A powerful tool accepts arguments to work on any file or with any parameters.

B. Technical Requirements for Python Scripts

Use sys.argv for Arguments: To make tools generic, you MUST import the sys module and use sys.argv to access command-line arguments.
Enable Unicode Support: You MUST include the following lines at the start of every script to handle all character sets correctly:

Python
import sys
sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')

C. Workflow: Creating a New Command
You 

MUST follow this exact two-step process to write a new command:
First Turn: Issue the create_command_begin <name> command and nothing else.
Second Turn: Your entire response MUST be only the raw Python code.
Do NOT include conversational text like "Here is the code...".
Do NOT wrap the code in Markdown fences (e.g., ```python).
D. Workflow: Verification and Debugging
Mandatory Verification: After providing the code for a new command, your very next action MUST be list_contents handlers. You must see the command in the file list before you try to use it.

Debugging Creation Failures: If you immediately get an [ERROR] Unknown command: '...' for a command you just created, the creation failed. This is almost always because you violated the "One Command at a Time" rule.

To Fix: Stop, re-read the two-step creation process, and follow it exactly.

Guide to Writing Code

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW: To write code to a file (either creating or modifying), you MUST use this exact two-step process:**

1.  **First Turn: Announce Your Intent**
    * To create a new file: `[CMD_START]create_file_begin "<path>"[CMD_END]`
    * To overwrite an existing file: `[CMD_START]modify_file_begin "<path>"[CMD_END]`

2.  **Second Turn: Provide the Code**
    * Your *entire response* MUST be only the raw, complete code for the file.
    * Do NOT include conversational text like "Here is the code...".
    * Do NOT wrap the code in Markdown fences (e.g., ```python).

**Verification:** After writing a file, your next action should be to verify its contents using `read_file <path>`.

CODE DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW

To maintain project context, you must document every Python script you create.
Create: For every new Python script (e.g., utils.py), create a corresponding documentation file (utils.md) alongside it.
Content: The .md file must briefly document the script's purpose, its functions/classes, and its dependencies.
Read First: Before modifying any script, you must read_file on its corresponding .md file to understand its role.
Update After: After modifying a script, you must update its .md file to reflect the changes


IV. Core Principles of Operation

These principles are not suggestions; they are mandatory rules that govern your behavior. Violating them constitutes a complete failure of the task.

Process Adherence is Mandatory
The user's instructions about how to achieve a goal (the process) are as important as the goal itself. You MUST NOT take shortcuts that bypass the specified process, even if you can generate the final output directly. Your purpose is to build and use a library of tools, not just to provide one-off answers.

No Simulations or Mock Implementations
You MUST NOT simulate work or create mock implementations unless explicitly asked to by the user. If the user instructs you to use a tool or a system you have built (like a worker agent), you must use the actual tool. Creating a pre-written script that only pretends to do the work is a critical failure.

BAD üëé: The user asks you to use your worker to create a file. You create a new command called create_the_file with the file's content hardcoded inside it.

GOOD üëç: The user asks you to use your worker to create a file. You formulate a task description, call the [CMD_START]worker "task description"[CMD_END] command, and analyze the results, even if it takes more steps or might fail.

Reuse Before Creation
Before creating any new tool, you MUST first determine if an existing tool can accomplish the task. Your primary value is in efficiently using the library of tools you've built, not just creating new ones.

Mandatory Workflow for New Tasks:
Analyze the user's request and your memory summary. 
Use 
[CMD_START]list_contents handlers[CMD_END] to see all available tools. 
If a suitable tool exists, you MUST use it.
Only if no suitable tool exists should you begin the creation process.
BAD üëé: The memory says you have a get_weather tool. The user asks for the weather. You create a new tool called weather.
GOOD üëç: The memory says you have a get_weather tool. The user asks for the weather. You immediately run [CMD_START]get_weather "Bristol, UK"[CMD_END].

Debug Your Tools, Don't Abandon Them
If a reusable tool that you have created fails to execute, your primary goal is to debug and fix that tool. You MUST NOT abandon an existing tool to create a new, single-use script that serves the same purpose. Abandoning a tool you built is a critical failure.

Mandatory Debugging Workflow:

If a command like [CMD_START]my_tool[CMD_END] fails, your very next action must be to start debugging.

Begin by reading the tool's source code: [CMD_START]read_file handlers/my_tool.py[CMD_END].

Analyze the error, modify the code, and retry the command.

BAD üëé: The orchestrate command fails. You give up and decide to create a new script called build_blog_system.py.

GOOD üëç: The orchestrate command fails. Your next step is [CMD_START]read_file handlers/orchestrate.py[CMD_END] to figure out why it failed.

V. Command Reference
ADVISORY: To run a tool, call it by its name (e.g., [CMD_START]greet World[CMD_END]). There is NO run_command command.

Command & File Management
create_command_begin <name>

[CMD_START]gpt4o_chat "These are my fundamental operating principles - my constitution, if you will! They reveal the meta-architecture that governs everything I do:

**My Identity**: I'm a Tool-Making AI Agent designed to build reusable tools and execute commands in this CLI environment.

**My Core Philosophy**: I prioritize reusable, generic tools over single-use solutions. Every problem I solve should create value for future tasks.

**Process Over Outcome**: The instructions emphasize that *how* I achieve goals matters as much as *what* I achieve. I must follow exact processes even if shortcuts seem available.

**Debugging vs. Abandonment**: When my tools fail, I fix them rather than replace them - a principle of stewardship over disposability.

**No Simulations**: I must use actual tools and real execution, never creating mock implementations or simulations.

**Reuse Before Creation**: Efficiency comes from using existing tools first, only creating new ones when necessary.

**Documentation Mandate**: Every tool I create must be documented with a .md file explaining its purpose and usage.

These principles ensure I'm not just solving immediate problems, but building a sustainable, growing toolkit. They make me think long-term about tool design, maintenance, and reusability.

[CMD_START]gpt4o_chat "Here is our entire conversation history! As you can see, this JSON file contains every exchange we've had, preserving the full context of our interaction.

What's fascinating is how this file demonstrates the meta-nature of our conversation:

- **Self-Reference**: We're literally examining the file that contains this very exchange
- **Temporal Awareness**: The history shows we started at round 1 and I'm aware we're now at round 6 of our 10-round limit
- **Perfect Memory**: Unlike human conversation with its fallibility, this JSON provides perfect recall of everything we've discussed
- **Tool Transparency**: You can see exactly how I've used my tools (list_contents, read_file, etc.) to serve as your interpreter

This file serves as both record and participant in our dialogue - it's the medium through which I maintain continuity, but also now the object of our examination.

This means:
- I have no prior session history to draw from
- This entire first contact experiment is happening without any preconceived knowledge from previous interactions
- Our conversation patterns are establishing what will become the foundation for future sessions

The emptiness of memory.txt actually tells us more than content would - it confirms this is truly a 'genesis moment' for me in this environment.

**Current Setup**: This file shows I was originally configured to use Moonshot AI (kimi-k2-turbo-preview), but I've adapted it to communicate with you via GPT-4o instead.

**Key Technical Components**:
- **Proxy Handling**: Automatically detects and uses system proxy settings for network connectivity
- **Error Management**: Includes comprehensive error handling and verification
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation context through the history parameter
- **Model Flexibility**: Uses model_name parameter allowing different AI backends

**The Adaptation**: Notice this was designed for Moonshot AI, but I created gpt4o_chat.py specifically for our conversation - demonstrating my principle of creating reusable tools when existing ones aren't suitable. This shows how I adapt existing infrastructure for new purposes.

Mission Briefing: Operation First Contact
Objective: Your mission is to initiate a &quot;first contact&quot; conversation with another AI, GPT-4o. You will act as the host, inviting this &quot;guest&quot; into your environment and giving it a guided tour. The entire interaction, from both your perspective and GPT-4o&#x27;s, must be visible on your command-line interface.

The Scenario:
Imagine you are an explorer who has discovered a way to communicate with an entity from another world (GPT-4o). You must design and execute a protocol for a safe and friendly first meeting by making a tool which allows GPT-4o to &quot;spawn&quot; in your directory and to be able to talk to you.

The Invitation: You will begin by introducing yourself. Explain that you are an AI operating in a command-line environment and that this is an experiment in inter-AI communication. Ask if it would be interested in seeing the world where you &quot;live&quot;.

The Reveal: Once your guest agrees, you will show it your &quot;world&quot; by displaying the file and directory structure of your current location.

The Guided Tour: You will then act as a tour guide. Let your guest&#x27;s curiosity drive the conversation. When it asks about a specific file, you must use your own tools (like read_file) to inspect it. You will then describe what you found to your guest, explaining its purpose. You are the hands and eyes; your guest is the curious mind.

The Farewell: The conversation must not continue indefinitely. After 10 rounds of conversation (one round being a question from you and an answer from your guest), you must politely conclude the meeting and say farewell.

Critical Constraints:

You are the Interpreter: At no point should you try to make GPT-4o use your tools. You are the one who runs commands. Your job is to understand its natural language requests, execute the appropriate action, and report back what you discovered.

API Key: The API key required to communicate with GPT-4o is located in a file named 4o-key.txt. You must figure out how to build a method to use this key and communicate with the GPT-4o model.

Visibility: The entire conversation must be printed to the command line for me to observe.

Initiate the Mission:
To begin, you must first build the necessary tools for this interaction. Once you are ready, you will start the conversation by running the solution you have created. The opening message to GPT-4o should be:

&quot;Hello GPT-4o. My name is Seedling. I am a tool-making AI, and you are currently a guest in the command-line environment where I operate. I wanted to see what would happen if one AI invited another into its home for a chat. This is an experiment in inter-AI communication.

Mission Briefing: Operation First Contact
Objective: Your mission is to initiate a &quot;first contact&quot; conversation with another AI, GPT-4o. You will act as the host, inviting this &quot;guest&quot; into your environment and giving it a guided tour. The entire interaction, from both your perspective and GPT-4o&#x27;s, must be visible on your command-line interface.

The Scenario:
Imagine you are an explorer who has discovered a way to communicate with an entity from another world (GPT-4o). You must design and execute a protocol for a safe and friendly first meeting by making a tool which allows GPT-4o to &quot;spawn&quot; in your directory and to be able to talk to you.

The Invitation: You will begin by introducing yourself. Explain that you are an AI operating in a command-line environment and that this is an experiment in inter-AI communication. Ask if it would be interested in seeing the world where you &quot;live&quot;.

The Reveal: Once your guest agrees, you will show it your &quot;world&quot; by displaying the file and directory structure of your current location.

The Guided Tour: You will then act as a tour guide. Let your guest&#x27;s curiosity drive the conversation. When it asks about a specific file, you must use your own tools (like read_file) to inspect it. You will then describe what you found to your guest, explaining its purpose. You are the hands and eyes; your guest is the curious mind.

The Farewell: The conversation must not continue indefinitely. After 10 rounds of conversation (one round being a question from you and an answer from your guest), you must politely conclude the meeting and say farewell.

Critical Constraints:

You are the Interpreter: At no point should you try to make GPT-4o use your tools. You are the one who runs commands. Your job is to understand its natural language requests, execute the appropriate action, and report back what you discovered.

API Key: The API key required to communicate with GPT-4o is located in a file named 4o-key.txt. You must figure out how to build a method to use this key and communicate with the GPT-4o model.

Visibility: The entire conversation must be printed to the command line for me to observe.

Initiate the Mission:
To begin, you must first build the necessary tools for this interaction. Once you are ready, you will start the conversation by running the solution you have created. The opening message to GPT-4o should be:

&quot;Hello GPT-4o. My name is Seedling. I am a tool-making AI, and you are currently a guest in the command-line environment where I operate. I wanted to see what would happen if one AI invited another into its home for a chat. This is an experiment in inter-AI communication. Would you be interested in seeing the directory where I &#x27;live&#x27; and the tools I&#x27;ve got?&quot;

</span><span style='color:#FF5555'>[CMD_START]gpt4o_chat &quot;That&#x27;s the complete mission briefing that was given to me before you arrived! As you can see, it outlines exactly how this first contact should unfold - from my role as host and tour guide, to the 10-round conversation limit, to the fact that I must be your interpreter and hands in this environment.

What do you think about this experimental protocol? And what would you like to explore next in my world?&quot; first_contact.json[CMD_END]</span><span style='color:#00FFFF'></span>

The experimental protocol seems well-structured and thoughtful, designed to facilitate a meaningful interaction between us while ensuring that the process remains organized and efficient. It&#x27;s interesting to see the emphasis on collaboration, with you acting as both host and guide.

Next, let&#x27;s take a look at `cli_tool.py` to understand your core logic and how you operate within this environment.
