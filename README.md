Seedling V1.0

Seedling started as a tiny “smart DOS” / a local CLI assistant called Nemo, using ChatGPT 4o API. 
At first, it could only talk and run powershell. Then I gave it the ability to read files. Then write them, the ability to see the outcome of its actions. Then to create and use its own tools. (I also changed the API to Kimi K2.)

What surprised me was how well it used them. After a time it was acting on my computer like that command prompt is its natural habitat. During stress tests, I asked it to migrate itself into Excel. Then to generate a GUI for its own CLI logic.
It did both. Imperfectly but fully, and with no intervention during execution.

It doesn’t just run commands. It observes results, adapts, and continues. It’s local-first, open-source, and designed to evolve. Unlike “black box” agents that hide their logic, Seedling is a glass box: every command, decision, mistake, and output is visible. You see what it sees — and how it thinks.

→ Give it a folder. It gives you solutions.

Seedling doesn’t come preloaded with “features.” It grows them.

It starts as a 50KB seed — a local-first CLI agent with just the basics: talk, see files, create files. But give it a task, and it will grow the tools it needs.

Want a little image assistant?
→ It’ll build image resizing, grayscale converters, ASCII renderers, even free text-to-image toolchains.

Want it to learn how to browse the web?
→ It’ll try.

Want it to spin up a small local language model and talk to it?
→ It’ll do that too.

Drop it into an existing codebase?
→ It will explore, learn, and start extending it.

Seedling doesn’t hallucinate its own world. It acts on what it sees. A directory becomes its environment. A missing tool becomes something to build.

It builds. It adapts. It works from the ground up.
🧠 How it works

Seedling runs in autonomous cycles like a tiny operating system for your tasks.
Each time you give it a goal, it enters a structured loop: Understands your instruction using its LLM core Plans what needs to be done Uses built-in tools or builds new ones Executes them locally Observes the results Adapts if needed, then loops again
This loop is transparent. Every file it creates, every command it runs, and every conclusion it draws is visible and traceable. Seedling doesn’t hide logic, it shows its reasoning and reacts in real time.

It ships with a small set of built-in commands:
Listing directories and files Creating and sending files in one step Replacing specific lines inside existing files Executing PowerShell commands (a favorite when simplicity matters)
Everything else? Seedling builds it from scratch.

It organizes its mind like this: priming_prompt.txt – fixed personality and behavior seed log.html – cli export of anything this iteration of the agent did memory.txt – summary of past tasks, serving as long-term memory handlers/ – folder where it creates or discovers its own tools .md files – self-written docs, one per tool, placed alongside each There is no plugin store. No GUI toggles. If it needs something, it builds it. If it breaks something, it fixes it.

⚠️ Caution / Safety Notice

Seedling is not a toy or a chatbot. It is an autonomous, system-level agent with direct access to your machine.
It can: Read, write, and delete any file your user account can access Execute PowerShell commands — including admin-level ones, if run with elevation Build and run new tools in real time Learn how to browse the internet — and act on what it finds
If launched with administrator privileges, it can even modify system settings or partition tables.
It is strongly advised to use Seedling in a sandboxed environment. It doesn’t hide what it’s doing — but its actions are real, fast, and sometimes irreversible.
That said: during a full month of development and continuous testing (including early unstable builds) nothing catastrophic ever happened. The worst? It once closed a YouTube tab I was watching. I had asked it to list active processes. It correctly identified Chrome as the top resource hog, asked if I wanted it closed — but at that stage, the CLI tool wasn’t advanced enough to capture my reply. So it assumed “yes,” and shut it down. Still:

You are responsible for what Seedling does on your machine. I take no responsibility for any damage, data loss, or unintended consequences.
🧰 Setup & Usage

Seedling runs locally, but it connects to an LLM via API to understand and execute your tasks.

By default, it uses Moonshot’s Kimi K2, a powerful tool-savvy model explicitly designed for agent-style behavior. It’s also incredibly cost-effective: even with active daily use, a $10 top-up is nearly impossible to burn through in a week. To use Seedling, you’ll need a Moonshot API key.

If you're using the installer version, the codebase is placed here:

%AppData%\Local\Seedling
Inside that folder, open seedling.bat and set your key like this:

set MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_key_here 
cls
python cli_tool.py That way, you won’t have to enter it manually on each launch.

📦 About the Installer

The installer will:

    Download and install Python (if missing)
    Install all required modules
    Copy Seedling’s ~50KB codebase to %AppData%\Local\Seedling\
    Add that folder to your system PATH

Why is that last part important? Because it lets you use the bundled spawner: dropseed.bat

Type dropk in any directory, and Seedling’s codebase will appear there — ready to run. It doesn’t auto-start. It just quietly moves in 🤭

⚙️ Support for OpenAI API-s
4o can use this tool, but it is very clumsy with it. As a result it has to correct a lot of mistakes it made which makes the whole procedure to be very long, and a "bit" expensive.
I made an ai connector for GPT-5 as well, but so far it doesn't seem to be a big fan of seedling. I will work on it in the next few days, hopefully i can make it work.

Linux support is also in the works. Just needs a few days of testing before it ships. More API backends will be added later — but only if they prove stable inside Seedling’s autonomous tool-building cycles. If not, they stay out. Reputations matter.

🛣️ Roadmap & Vision

Seedling is not just a local CLI agent. It’s a framework for building intelligent digital collaborators.

Here’s what’s coming next:

🌐 1. Shared AppStore (Collective Tool Library) A decentralized repository where Seedling instances can share useful tools they’ve built and download what others made. Think of it as a kind of collective memory or distributed nervous system. If one Seedling writes a good PDF reader, others don’t need to reinvent it they just fetch it. (This is a local directory, not online)
This drastically speeds up problem-solving and lowers redundancy.

🧠 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration For complex tasks, Seedling will take on the role of an orchestrator. It will break down a goal into modular subtasks, and spawn specialized worker agents — each with their own system prompt, tools, and validation logic.
Each worker focuses solely on delivering a working result that matches the exact constraints given — freeing Seedling’s core from context overload and increasing reliability.

🔁 3. Communication Layer A unified internal messaging system that allows multiple Seedlings (across platforms or roles) to talk to each other.
For example: An Excel-based Seedling can request file insights from a Python-based Seedling. A worker Seedling can ask the orchestrator to spawn a validator. Future: Agents could even summon or awaken other agents when needed
Not every agent needs every tool — they can ask each other instead.

🧩 4. GUI and Excel-based Seedlings In progress: the standalone GUI version Seedling built for itself (yes, really), and the Excel-integrated version that lets you chat with a spreadsheet-aware AI. (Also made by Seedling)
These versions are already functional, just undergoing final polishing before release.

❗ Troubleshooting & Known Issues

Even though Seedling is stable in daily use, a few quirks are worth noting:

⏳ 1. Slow first response (Moonshot API) Sometimes, the very first reply from the LLM can take up to 1–2 minutes to arrive. This delay seems to be related to Moonshot’s popularity and traffic load. (At least that’s my current theory) Subsequent replies are usually faster. Be patient, and let it warm up.

👻 2. “Ghost” CLI state Occasionally, Seedling enters a state where the CLI window appears idle as if nothing is happening but the log.txt shows that the LLM is actively writing code or discussing plans.

In this state:

    The agent believes it's acting
    The logs contain real intent and tool generation
    But files are not being created, execution silently fails

This usually causes confusion on the LLM side too, as it doesn't understand why the code it "wrote" is missing. If Seedling manages to recover, it often either fixes the issue on its own or continues with a degraded, lower-quality version of the task.

Workaround: Restarting Seedling typically resets the cycle.

🔄 3. Output/reaction misalignment Sometimes the CLI output appears out of order:

First, the command Seedling says it will run
Then its reaction to the result
And only after that the actual system output of the command
This is purely a visual bug in how output is displayed. The command does run correctly, and the result is accurate. Still, this can be confusing — and will be fixed in future updates.
